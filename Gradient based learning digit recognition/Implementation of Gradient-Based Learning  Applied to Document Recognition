Implementation of Gradient-Based Learning 
Applied to Document Recognition

Abstractâ€”Multilayer neural networks trained with the 
back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a 
successful gradient based learning technique. Given an 
appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning 
algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface 
that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten 
characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews 
various methods applied to handwritten character recognition 
and compared them on a standard handwritten digit recognition 
task. Convolution Neural Networks, that are specifically 
designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown 
outperform all other techniques. It uses convolutional neural 
network (CNN) character recognizers combined with global 
training techniques to provide record accuracy
